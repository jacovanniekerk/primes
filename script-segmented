Hi.
Apparently shorter videos are preferred, so here goes:
The vanilla sieve of eros-tha-thu-nees's memory requirement grows with O(n)
- bad for large N.  Little locality of reference, so no caching. 
Segmented version of the sieve much better.
Step 1:  Calculate all primes up to sqrt of n and save in array. Why? See PNT.
Step 2:  Pick segment size based on memory availability.  
Step 3:  Mark them off in the usual way, extract and store.
Step 4:  Repeat Step 3 for all segments.

Here's the code.
[quick code]
Test with n = x
[run]
It works
kay, thanks, bye. Like and Subscrible.

Why are you still here?  Too short?  You need a better explanation?
Okay... if that is what you want.
